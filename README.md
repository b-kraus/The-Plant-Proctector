# The-Plant-Proctector
Group 41: David Myers, Beth Kraus final project.

This project will help a plant owner take care of their plant by being notified if the humidity or soil moisture of said plant is not optimal. A buzzer, and a notification via wifi will trigger so that the user can tend to their plant.
